    <h2>Sinigang na Isda or Bangus (Milkfish) is a Native Filipino Dish</h2>
    <p>Sinigang is one of the easiest Filipino dishes to make. I recommend this to everyone, especially those who have little to no cooking experience.</p>
    <p>Unlike regular sinigang na isda, this version makes use of fried fish. I intentionally fried fresh fish to make sinigang because it adds more flavor. Compared to using raw fish, having fried fish when cooking sinigang makes a huge difference. Try it to see.</p>
